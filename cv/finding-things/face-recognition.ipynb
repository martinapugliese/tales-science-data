    "\n",
    "As humans, recognising what's in a face is a very quick task, mundane even for our daily life, although the specifics of what happens in the human brain are still to be fully understood. This [[article]](#sciam) narrates a recent breakthrough (at the time of writing this at least) on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "As machines though, the situation is different. There have been approaches based on vectors built with geometrical features [[1]](#kanade), but they have been proven to not be good enough. Standard methods today consist in training a Machine Learning  classifier (we are not considering recent Deep Learning approaches here, yet)."

    "\n",
    "The *eigenfaces* (yes, they are really called like that) are the set of eigenvectors outlining the major properties of a face and derived via PCA and used to train a classifier. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface) has a good page on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is a high-dimensional object and not all the features which can be inferred from its pixels are relevant. The steps of the algorithm computing the eigenfaces are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a large training set of images of faces, ideally taken under the same light conditions;\n",
    "2. Normalise them in such a way to have eyes and mouth aligned and then resampled to the same pixel resolution;\n",
    "2. Perform a PCA and project the original images onto the chosen components;\n",
    "3. The query image is then projected on the principal components as well;\n",
    "4. Use a distance method to compare the projected query image and the projected training images\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with computing the PCA on many large images is about performance. With 400 $10^2 \\times 10^2$ images, the covariance matrix will be $10^4 \\times 10^4$. Thankfully though, note that a $M \\times N$ matrix with $M > N$ has only $N-1$ non-zero eigenvalues, so the problem becomes much more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact what we can do is apply this little small trick. Instead of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $XX^T$, where  $X$ is the dataset matrix,  which is a $M \\times M$ matrix, we can use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $X^TX$, which is a  $N \\times N$ matrix, much smaller. Because matrix multiplication is associative, this gives:\n",

    "\n",
    "A PCA in the eigenfaces approach finds linear combinations of features that maximise the total variance in the data. This way, some discriminative information can be lost when throwing away the components which do not contribute much to the variance. This is particularly a problem when variance is generated by an external source in the images, like light and this is why that approach works well only when images are taken in the same conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fisherface approach is a sort of correction on this problem which uses a Linear Discriminant Analysis, which allows for class-specific dimensionality reduction. See this nice page on [Scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Fisherfaces)."
