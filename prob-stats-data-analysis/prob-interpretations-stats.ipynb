This assumes a sufficiently large (?) number of trials in the first place and assumes that this frequency will asymptotically converge to the probability of our event when said number of trials goes to $\\infty$. \n",

The [Bayes' theorem](distribution-measures/bayes.ipynb) links the degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for the evidence, that is, the result of the data observation. In some sense, this interpretation is nearer to the layman's one: the probability encompasses the belief in something, the prior knowledge of the phenomenon at hand. \n",
