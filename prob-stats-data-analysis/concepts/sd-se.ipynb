It will be a subset of the population and this is the typical situation: we don't have access to the full population, we can only use the sample to derive information. The population follows a certain distribution, of which the distribution of the sample is an \"approximation\". This is why we have to use the sample mean (the mean of data points in the sample) as an estimate of the (unknown) population mean. The problem is now how to attribute the error to this value.\n",

    "Now because we're using the sample mean to estimate the mean (expected value) of the population, and because if we had another sample extracted from the same population this sample mean would likely be different, in general this sample mean follows its distribution. The *standard error* (of the mean, as it can be related to other statistics), typically indicated by *SE*, is the standard deviation of these means. \n",
