# Adminy of the repo

Supporting material used in the notebooks.

## Using the repo

If you intend to use the repo by running the notebooks yourself, you want to add to the PYTHONPATH env var in order to point to where you put the repo, as there are some imports from the `common/` folder in the notebooks.

## Adminy folders

Folders not listed here are actual book material.

### [common_methods/](common_methods/)

Keeps some methods used all over the place, for convenience reasons.

### [datasets/](datasets/)

Some free data used in some notebooks for illustrative purposes. Typically classic, old datasets used now for pedagogical reasons.

### [imgs/](imgs/)

Contains supporting images used in the notebooks as illustrations. Some are hand-drawn and photographed, (most of which are terrible).

### [style-files/](style-files/)

Files to style up the notebooks and plots.

## Stuff you need

In the repo are Jupyter notebooks and to make full use of them you'd need the whole stack of Python for data science, plus a few other things.
