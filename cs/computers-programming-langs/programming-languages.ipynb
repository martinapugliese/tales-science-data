    "Are two opposing ones. In an *imperative* paradigm, algorithms are implemented in explicit steps and statements are used to change the state: statements are the smallest standalone instructions.\n",
    "In a *declarative* paradigm, algorithms are logically expressed without the explicit list of instructions (for example with the use of list comprehensions in Python). \n",

    "\n",
    "The *functional* programming paradigm, belonging to the declarative class, treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and is based on lambda calculus, avoiding statements. Examples of functional languages are Clojure, Haskell; other that support the functional paradigm are Python, R, Java, Scala. \n",

    "Scala is a functional programming language that runs on the JVM (Java virtual machine), meaning it gets compiled to Java bytecode, it is statically typed, object-oriented. The name stands for \"scalable language\" because it has been conceived to grow with demand of its users. The project started in 2001 at the E. Polytechnique de Lausanne by M Odersky and it is taking more and more interest in the data science community. "

    "An *interpreter* interprets the language, in that when you write your high-level instructions it goes searching for the corresponding binary code, which is part of itself. The difference with a compiler is that this process is executed at run time, making interpreted code sensibly slower than compiled one. Examples are Python and Ruby. "
