    "*Bit* stands for binary digit and it's a switch representation: you got a switch which can take a binary value. 8 bits compose the so called *byte*, and this is a convention which grew to be agreed upon with time: changing with hardware and operating system. IBM in 1956 established the 8-bit standard, which won over other systems because it could accommodate the 256 [ASCII](http://ee.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/Book/chap4/subsection2.1.1.1.html) characters: 26 upper chars, 26 lower chars, the 10 digits and the most important punctuation marks. \n",

    "The phrasing *random access* is rather misleading. It's not a random memory in the sense that stuff is placed in random spots, *random access* means it uses the same time to access each byte in memory, as opposed to a tape which you'd have to walk for access at a specific location. More specifically, it means that a program accesses variables which have been allocated in some places of the memory and does not look for them by scrolling sequentially."
