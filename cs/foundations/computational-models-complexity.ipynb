    "## The Turing Machine\n",

    "The Turing machine is an idelisation of a computational device, effectively a mathematical representation. It is composed by an infinite tape where symbols are sequentially written, a scanning element that reads what is in the current location of the tape, and a set of instructions (rules) to be followed. The rules specify what to do when a certain symbol is encountered: the machine can overwrite it with another one, erase it or do nothing. It is conceived as a model for computation as it can perform any algorithm.\n",

    "The Turing machine is deterministic when the rule applied to the same situation is always the same. It is non-deterministic when the rule for the same situation is not unique. "

It's not necessarily straighforward to prove that a problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time, and research in the field is still very much active: this paper [[3]](#prime) proved (in 2004) that detecting if a number is prime is P.\n",

An equivalent definition is that NP problems are those verifiable efficiently, that is in polynomial time with deterministic computation.  It can be shown that the two definitions are equivalent.\n",
    "*NP-hard* problems are those which are at least as hard as the hardest problems in the NP class. The *NP-complete* problems are those problems which are both NP and NP-hard.\n",

    "\n",
    "The P problems are those \"efficiently solvable\", the NP ones are those \"efficiently verifiable\" (given the solution, it can be verified); efficiently here means in polynomial time and with deterministic computation. The *P versus NP* is an open question in computer science: can all problems which can be efficiently verified also be efficiently solved? Head to [[4]](#pversusnp) for a very readable explanation and review of the efforts in the area."
