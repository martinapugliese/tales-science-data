# Tales of Science & Data

> A semi-serious collection of notes on Data Science, from Statistics to Machine Learning, passing through all sorts of other related things. Not necessarily in the order you'd expect.


## Some meta
 
*What exactly is this? Why did I even bother doing this? How did I choose to do this?*

* The [**about**](about.md) gives a (sorta) detailed explanation from conception till realisation, and the structure and choices;
* The [**adminy**](adminy.md) documents the folders which are supporting material;
* The [**resources file**](resources.md) lists some data science material which I find brilliant and goes cross-topics, note that references to the single topics are listed in the respective notebooks instead.

Following here is the table of contents with links pointing to the chapters, where you can then proceed to the single topics.


## [Probability, Statistics and Data Analysis](prob-stats-data-analysis/README.md)

*Statistics is at the core of data science, and thourough data analysis is typically the starting point of any modelling effort on data.*

* **General Intro**
* **Foundational concepts on distributions and measures**
* **Hypothesis testing**
* **Methods, theorems and laws**
* **Notable brain teasers and paradoxes, and how to be careful with data**

## [Natural Language Processing](nlp/README.md)

*NLP is the field (a part of Machine Learning) which deals with text, an unstructured data source. What NLP tries to do is putting text into numerical representations, and extracting information from it, in an attempt to do understand (?) it.*

* **General concepts and tasks in NLP**
* **Manipulating text and extracting information**
* **Topic Modelling**
* **Word Embeddings**


## [Computer Vision](cv/README.md)

*Can a machine view? Well, an image is a matrix so it's all algebraic operations!*

* **Intro and quantifying images**
* **Processing an image**
* **What's in an image**

## [Toolbox](toolbox/README.md)

*An overview in a rush of some of the usual suspects used in data science, from programming languages to frameworks and various tools.*

* **The Python data stack**
* **Databases and distributed frameworks**

## [Machine Learning: general concepts](ml-general/README.md)

*What is Machine Learning, and its building blocks.*

* A learning machine
* Regularisation
* Classifying data

### [Choosing features](feat-eng/README.md)

* Engineering features
* Selecting features


## [Supervised Learning](supervised-learning/README.md)

* Regression
* Classification
* Both Regression and Classification


## [Unsupervised Learning](unsupervised-learning/README.md)

* Clustering


## [Artificial Neural Networks](neural-nets/README.md)

* What are they and how they work, in general
* Types of artificial neurons and networks


## [Model Assessment](model-assessment/README.md)

* Problems of a model
* Performance metrics and techniques
* Performance diagnostics


## [Computer Science](cs/README.md)

* Foundational concepts and components
* Computers and programming languages
* Algorithms


## [Some Mathematical Results](maths/README.md)

* Generic results
* Mathematical algorithms
* Dimensionality Reduction and Matrix Factorisation
