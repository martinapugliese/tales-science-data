# Tales of Science & Data

**A semi-serious collection of notes on Data Science.**


## Meta
 
What exactly is this? Why did I even bother doing this? How did I choose to do this?

* The [**about**](about.md) gives a (sorta) detailed explanation from conception till realisation, and the structure and choices (it's a bit of a stream of consciousness)
* The [**adminy**](adminy.md) documents the folders which are supporting material

Material in the collection span a quite large and variegated set of topics, explored here into these sections. 


## [Probability, Statistics and Data Analysis](prob-stats-data-analysis/README.md)

*Statistics is at the core of data science, and thourough data analysis is typically the starting point of any modelling effort on data.*

* **General Intro**
* **Distributions and probability measures**
* **Foundational concepts**
* **Hypothesis testing**
* **Notable brain teasers and paradoxes, and how to be careful with data**
* **Methods, theorems and laws in Statistics**
