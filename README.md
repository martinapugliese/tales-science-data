# The intro

A project by [**Martina Pugliese**](https://martinapugliese.github.io/).

_This book is a collection of notes on Data Science, from Statistics to Machine Learning, passing through all sorts of related areas._

I've decided to give forms to a rather disorderly collection of notes I had about data science & all sorts of related areas, so here it how this project has generated. You can read more in the Meta page about the how's and the why's of this.

## Contents

### Meta and Resources

_This section explains how this whole thing has started and why, what it is and how it's done, plus some awesome resources found on the web._

### Probability, Statistics & Data Analysis

_A collection of notes on topics regarding Probability and Statistics and the way to use them to analyse data and draw conclusions._

### Machine Learning: Concepts and Procedures

_How do we do Machine Learning? This chapter offers a high-level overview of the techniques and methodologies._

## About the code parts

Several pages contain snippets of code. I've been using Python \(3\) and for those pages a link to a relative Jupyter notebook in the Github repo corresponding to this book is provided for your perusal if you want to play around. The overall repo is reachable on Github at this [link](https://github.com/martinapugliese/tales-science-data) and you can also visualise notebooks prettyfied via nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/martinapugliese/tales-science-data/tree/master/).

The libraries used in the notebooks are usually \(unless specified\) those of the Python data stack \(Numpy, Scipy, sklearn, Pandas\). The plots presented in here have been customised, the repo contains all styling files.

## Notify me of mistakes

Mistakes happen. Inaccuracies and oversights as well, from the content point to view to the rendering/graphics one \(e.g., one TeX formula doesn't appear rendered\). You are more than welcome, encouraged in fact, to [submit issues](https://github.com/martinapugliese/tales-science-data/issues) to the repo for these things.
