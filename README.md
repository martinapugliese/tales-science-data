_This book is a collection of notes on Data Science, from Statistics to Machine Learning, passing through all sorts of related areas._

I've decided to give forms to a rather disorderly collection of notes I had about data science & all sorts of related areas, so here it how this project has generated. You can read more in the Meta page about the how's and the why's of this.

## Sections
