    "## What is in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called *Latent Semantic Indexing*, it is a technique first described in [[1]](#1) and then in [[2]](#2). It is a method which uses [SVD](../../maths/dim-reduction/svd.ipynb) to identify patterns in collections of texts encoded numerically in a matrix. The bulk of the idea is that words used in the same context have similat meanings, so that semantically related terms show latent correlations. In the context of Information Retrieval, this allows a query against documents which have undergone LSA to output results which are conceptually similar in meaning to the query even if the words are not the same, so this works as an improvement of a simple keyword search."

    "* The first thing is to build the term-document matrix $M$, an $n \\times m$ matrix ($n$ number of documents in collection, $m$ number of unique terms)\n",
    "* Then we weigh the data in the matrix so that each cell value $m_{ij}$ becomes a multiplication of a local weight $l_{ij}$ (a function of the relative frequency $f_{ij}$ of the term $i$ in document $j$) and a global weight $g_i$ (the relative frequency of term $i$ in the entire collection of documents)\n",

    "        0 \\text{ else}\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "    * *term frequency*: the actual number of occurrences $f_{ij}$ of term $i$ in doc $j$\n",

    "    * *augnorm*: $\\frac{\\frac{f_{ij}}{\\max_{ij} f_{ij}}}{2}$\n",

    "    * *GF-IDF* : $g_i = \\frac{f^g_i}{d_i}$, where $f^g_i$ is the total number of times term $i$ appears in the whole collection ($g$ stands for \"global\"); $d_i$ is the number of documents in which term appears\n",
