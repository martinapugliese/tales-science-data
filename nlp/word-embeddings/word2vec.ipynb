    "\n",
    "word2vec, whose original paper is [[1]](#paper) is a model based on a shallow neural network for word embeddings, conceived at Google in 2013. It utilises a large corpus of text as its input and maps each unique word to a numerical vector; it relies on the \"distributional hypothesis\" of linguistics, which basically asserts that a word per se isn't complete without its context (\"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\", J R Firth, 1957). \n",

    "<img src=\"../../imgs/kingmanqueenwoman.jpg\" width=\"500\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 50px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fancy way of saying that word2vec uses information on the neighbouring words of a given word to derive information. For example, the word \"bank\" can be either the financial institution or the bank of a river, and context is key. wowrd2vec employs a \"window\" around a word (a number of other words on each side) to capture the information on its context. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of word vectors is often exemplified (see figure) by saying that it is capable of performing vector arithmetics such that, say, you can obtain the vector for queen from those of king, man and woman.\n",

    "word2vec can also be used to translate words from a language to another one, with a rotation matrix.\n",

    "Let's say we have the sentence *the cat chases the mouse* and that the word at hand is *chases*, and let's also say that we have a vocabulary $V$. We want to maximise the likelihood of seeing the context words given the one word we are considering, which is, for each of those context words, of the form $P( w_c | chases)$, $w_c$ being the context word. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each word, two vectors get built depending on whether the word is in input ($w_{in}$) or in output ($w_{out}$), so that for instance $P(w_{out} | w_{in}) = P(chases | the)$. These probabilities are derived from the cosine similarity, but using a softmax:\n",

Now, for a general linearly scaling problem you can always build a tree to make it scale logarithmically instead, and this is what the actual algorithm does, endin up with a complexity $O(NC \\log V)$, which allows for it to be able to scale to $10^{11}$ words.\n",

In the example sentence above, words *cat* and *mouse* would be context words for *chases*. The network we described above has to be modified in such a way that the input layer gets replicated C times, where C is the number of context words. The hidden layer will perform a division by C.\n",

    "\n",
    "Negative sampling is a method based on the skip-gram model but that optimises a different objective. It makes the whole procedure more efficient as it prevents vectors from having the same values by disallowing some word-context pairs: the idea is to train on a random sample from the context instead of on all of it (in fact, the computation of the dot product with all words in the context is very slow). Negative sampling tackles the problem of having too many output vectors to be updated at every iteration by updating just a sample of them, selected via a probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The wording \"negative\" comes from the fact that we call \"positive\" those words selected for being in the context and \"negative\" those which are chosen by sampling and deemed too similar to the given word, so excluded. The probability distribution for the sampling can be arbitrarily chosen, it is usually called the *noise distribution*.\n",

    "<img src=\"../../imgs/hierarchical-softmax.jpg\" width=\"300\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin:0px 50px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a more efficient way to compute the softmax; it uses a binary tree to represent all words in the vocabulary. In this representation, words do not gent encoded as vectors because vectors are given for the inner units (the inned unit $n(w, j)$ is the j-th units on the path from the root to word $w$). This way, the complexity gets reduced from $O(V)$ to $O(\\log V)$ and this tweak can then be used both in the CBOW and in the skip-gram model. The difference with the negative-sampling approach, which reduces the size, is that all context is kept but the computational complexity is reduced. "
