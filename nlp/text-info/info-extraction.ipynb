Effectively, what you do is identifying constituent parts of sentences and linking them up together in higher order units. In the image, you got a sentence which has been separate into its noun phrases constituents.\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance, we establish that the rule for which a NP-chunk is formed is when a DT is followed by adjectives (JJ) and a noun (NN), so the chunker will use pattern `<DT>?<JJ>*<NN>`, chunking all sentences starting with the optional determiner, then followed by zero or more adjectives and a noun. \n",
