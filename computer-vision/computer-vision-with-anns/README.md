# Computer Vision with ANNs

_This section will explore the more recent, state-of-the-art uses of ANNs within the realm of Computer Vision, which has produced several breakthroughs and continues to improve. There is still much debate around the community of researchers and practitioners in regards to the current value of "traditional" Computer Vision approaches with respect to ANNs ones \(see references\)._ 

It is generally understood that currently the use of deep neural networks \("Deep Learning", which we may refer to as DL\) applied to images is providing unmatched quality in results. However, these techniques require a large expenditure in terms of training time, data volumes needed and also specific hardware. As for many things, whether using Deep Learning for your task or not may be a matter of circumstances; it will also depend on the task though.  
Nowadays, since the appearance of the recent breakthroughs in the field, things such as object detection \(the detection of objects within a picture, with their location\), are for instance the prototype of a task which is virtually always done via DL, at least for complex sets of objects. The classification of images \(deciding whether a picture is a cat or a dog\) is another task where DL approaches do great. 

There are plenty of problems in CV which are however still well addressed by "traditional" techniques. In fact, in cases where speed and resources are an issue and the problem is simple enough, those methods can go a long way. We have seen in the previous [section](../whats-in-an-image/object-detection-without-neural-networks.md) how even object detection can be done without DL.  
  
As with everything when it comes to the use of neural networks, the advancements in the field, which have been booming lately have been made possible by the outstanding availability of data and the decreasing price of computational power. This section will explore some of the applications of DL in Computer Vision, with the ideas behind the techniques and examples.
