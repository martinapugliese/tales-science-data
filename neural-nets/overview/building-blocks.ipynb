If in a network there were no hidden layer, it would be easy to change the weights in such a way that the output matches the expected real output.

One can apply $L_2$ or $L_1$ regularisation terms as per usual, or another common choice in neural networks is the so-called *dropout*, which works by actually modifying the network itself. What you do is starting with the whole network as is and then removing some of the neurons in the hidden layers (call them \"dropout neurons\"), choosing them at random. You make it proceed as normal and then repeat the procedure by choosing another set of dropout neurons. The fact that you'll have just some of the original neurons in the hidden layers has to be compensated by changing their outputs accordingly. The whole mechanism is a sort of averaged result of the training of different networks and the reason why it works in reducing overfitting is because with less neurons in the hidden parts there is less complexity the networks learns, and then an averaged result is computed.
