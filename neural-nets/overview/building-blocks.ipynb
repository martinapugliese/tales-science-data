Now, with sigmoid neurons we have the deivative of the sigmoid which is very small when the output if close to 1, as the curve flattens, and this makes the learning quite slow. \n",

    "\n",
    "What you do is starting with the whole network as is and then removing half of the neurons in the hidden layers (call them \"dropout neurons\"), choosing them at random. You make it proceed as normal and then repeat the procedure by choosing another set of dropout neurons. The fact that you'll have half the neurons in the hidden layers has to be compensated by halving their outputs as well. The whole mechanism is a sort of averaged result of the training of different networks and the reason why it works in reducing overfitting is because with less neurons in the hidden parts there is less complexity the networks learns, and then an averaged result is computed.

    "The easiest way to initialise the network weights is to extract them at random from a Gaussian distribution. If you choose a Gaussian with standard deviation 1 for all neurong, you end up with the variable $\\sum_j w_j x_j + b$ being distributed with a Gaussian which is very broad. This will make for easy saturation in several neurons as due to this broadness the probability to have large values is not so small and so the result of the sigmoid function will be easily close to 0 or 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this, the usual choice is to extract the weights from a Gaussian with standard deviation equal to $\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{n_{in}}}$, $n_{in}$ being the number of input weights in the neuron."
