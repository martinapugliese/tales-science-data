    "## The gist of what they are\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (often shortened as ANN) is, well, an attempt at artificially representing the network of neurons in the brain and their functioning with software. \n",
    "It consists of neural units (*artificial neurons*), each capable of receiving input and producing output based on rules, and which are connected together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fun thing about ANNs, and the whole point of them, is the fact that they mimic \"learning\". Inputs to the network are weighted and the learning mechanism consists in an iterative self-adjustment of said weights in such a way to achieve optimal correspondence to the desired result on training data. This way, the network is meant to emulate the synapses of the brain in their capability to carry information to one neuron to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A bit on the biological link\n",
    "\n",
    "The biological metaphor of these algorithms to actual neural networks in the brain is more of an inspiration than a grounded reality. ANNs were conceived with the idea to mimic how the human brain works but they are a far shout from actually doing this comprehensively, and also, we don't know the human brain well enough yet anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following [[1]](#biology), we can say that, in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "* real neurons are slower than artificial ones, but there's really plenty and the way they communicate is non-trivial\n",
    "* real networks use energy very efficiently\n",
    "* real networks can do several highly complex operations at a time"

    "## Artificial neurons and their working\n",
    "\n",
    "This here is the generic model of an artificial neuron, indicated by index $j$.\n",
    "You got input data $(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ flowing into it, which gets weighted with the neuron's weights $(w_{1j}, \\ldots, w_{nj})$ so that you get the transfer function (a combination of all inputs and their weights) and feed it into the activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function will decide what to output based on what it receives and based on a threshold the neuron is equipped with. \n",
