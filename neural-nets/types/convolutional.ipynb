A typical CNN architecture is made of a convolutional layers base plus some other types of layers.\n",

Their architecture is indeed specifically designed to deal with image input data, and in fact neurons are arranged to follow the geometrical distributions of images data: there are the width and height dimensions, plus the one for the colour channel. \n",

    "The reason to use convolutional networks (whose specifics follow here) to deal with images is that \"regular\" fully connected nets would not replicate the geometry of the input data and would, more importantly, need too many parameters to be trained with success in a typical case. Also, we know that artificial neural networks have been inspired by biology; CNNs in particular have been conceived out of an inspiration from the visual cortex, where different neurons respond to different regions of the input space (see receptive fields below) and that visual neurons are organised in a matrix format, see the [[experiments]](#huber-wiesel) carried out by Hubel and Wiesel in the '50s and '60s where they have demonstrated this. \n",

    "### Convolution and local receptive fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution operation that these types of networks apply to the input data consists in the fact that each neuron has the task of dealing with a specific region of the input. In a typical convolutional structure, input neurons take the pixels of the image and hidden neurons are such that each of them only communicates to a region of the input image. These regions shift when you move from one neuron to the next; this is the concept of *local receptive fields*, brilliantly illustrated in chapter 6 of Nielsen's [[book]](#nielsen), where the following images are taken from. Specifically, these images illustrate the concept via the example of a 28X28 input image (it's the classic example of the handwritten digits recognition from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) and a 24X24 first hidden layer where each neuron deals with a region 5X5 (*receptive field*).\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing over the input image in shifting local regions means building the combination of input pixels and weights via a *filter*, or *kernel*, which is a matrix of weights the size of the receptive field. The filter is applied to the receptive field of image pixels to build the linear combination, which will then be argument of the activation function as per usual. The linear combination is built element-wise: each pixel is multiplied to its corresponding filter value and then all factors are summed up. This whole procedure is the essence of convolution, the name refers to the shifting of the filter one pixel at a time. The output of a convolutional layer is called a *feature map*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that for an image of shape $n \\times n$ (imagine this is a matrix, so the image is black and white; in the case of a coloured one you'd have the third dimension for the colour space), and using a kernel $m \\times m$, with $m < n$, via this operation you end up with the output of the application of the filter which is $(n - m + 1) \\times (n - m + 1)$, so dimensionality is reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have illustrate the concept here with the assumption that the kernel will shift by one pixel every time. That's the typical situation, but there can be situations where you want the kernel to shift by a higher number of pixels, a quantity that is called the *stride*. The other parameter is the *padding*. We've seen that the application of a convolutional layer reduces the dimensionality of the data; if this is best to be avoided you can set some padding of chosen size, that is, add some 0 pixels around the input matrix borders so that effectively you're passing a bigger image. See these excellent blogs [[6]](#deshpande) on this."

    "### What is the effect of convolution on the input image: shape detections\n",
    "\n",
    "With the application of convolution, the network learns features of the input image. Features are the shapes in it. If you have a shape in an image, say a sequence of pixels forming the shape of a curve, by applying the filter to it and via the sum of the multiplications it performs on the image, you will have large numbers when the weights in the filter are in the same locations of the curve beneath: the filter activates. If on the other hand the applied filter does not find a match between its weights and the pixels beneath, the value of the sum of multiplications will be small. This is how the network recognises shapes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The feature map in output will contain these values and will then tell you which areas correspond to the passed filter: the filter is acting as a shape detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical case, you'd apply multiple filters to the input image, so to recognise different kinds of shapes: one for straight vertical lines, one for curves of a certain curvature, one for horizontal lines, etc. The feature map in output is a composite object with a dimension (depth) for the filters applied, so that each slice of it is the result of the application of one of the filters. The numbers of filters applied, i.e., its depth, constitutes the *channels* of the feature map."

In a usual structure you'd have a sequence of convolutional layers because you want to make the network learn more and more complicated shapes. This is the reason behind building deep convolutional networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first convolutional layer learns simple features, like straight lines and curves. The feature map that outputs from it gets passed as input to the second convolutional layer, which then takes these learned simple features (simple shapes) and does the same procedure, hence learning more complex shapes as a result. From little straight and curved lines to broader shapes. The third layer builds on top of these learned shapes, and so on. Effectively at each convolutional step (layer) you are training the network to recognise things in the image that are hyerarchically more complicated, till the end when it will have learned to recognise a dog, say, as the result of its many many shapes, from small to broad.\n",
