# Beautiful internet

Internet is a beautiful place, you can learn so much on it, for free. This document puts together some resources on or related to data science which are absolutely brilliant.

We already put references in every notebook created for details, more insight, citation purposes. Here, we list material which is comprehensively good: online courses, books, blogs, and which span several of the topics we touch on.

## Statistics and Probability

* [**Calling Bullshit** in the age of Big Data](http://callingbullshit.org), a course on spotting manipulative use of data, wrong conclusions and overall misunderstandings, @ University of Washington by C Bergstrom and J West
* [**How to lie with Statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics), a lovely little book on the common mistakes and misunderstandings around the use of numbers for reaching conclusions. Old, but very valuable and entertaining, by D Huff, 1954.
* [Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), a project by T Vigen which visually displays improbable correlations between sets of data to demonstrate that, well, correlation is not causation

## Machine Learning

* [Notes from the **Stanford course on ML**, by A Ng](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html)

### Neural Networks

* M Nielsen, [Neural Networks & Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), Determination Press, 2015, a fantastic online book
* [Deep Learning with **Keras** & **Tensorflow**](https://github.com/leriomaggio/deep-learning-keras-tensorflow), a tutorial by V Maggio

## Computer Vision

* [The Hypermedia Image Processing Reference](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/index.htm), a website built by the University of Edinburgh
* [**Pyimagesearch**](https://www.pyimagesearch.com), a website curated by A Rosebrock on Computer Vision and Machine/Deep Learning on images, with tutorials for OpenCV and lots of good material
