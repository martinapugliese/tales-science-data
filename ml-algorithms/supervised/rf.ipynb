    "## What is\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Random (decision) Forest* is an ensemble learning method used for both for classification and regression. It is based on a brilliant yet simple idea: training a bunch of decision trees together to improve the accuracy reachable with of a single tree and address its problems, for example overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first paper out which explores this method dates back to 1995 [[1]](#1), Breiman then formalised the concepts and set them down in [[2]](#2) in the early 2000s. He and Cutler also registered a [tradermark](https://trademarks.justia.com/786/42/random-78642027.html) for the method."

    "## How does it work\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a *classification* problem, the output of a forest is the mode of all classes spit out by individual trees, that is, the most frequent one; in the case of a *regression* problem, the output is the average of the predictions of individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is fitting a number of decision trees, each on a sampled replica of the training set and use averaging to improve the accuracy and to control for overfitting. Each of these samples is chosen in such a way to have the same size as the original training set, but data is sampled with replacement so that effectively you are building replicas of the whole training set. This methodology is called *bagging* (short for bootstrap aggregating) and it's good way to decrease variance without increasing the bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is reduced by bagging, if we compare to a single decision tree. Also, note that if we were to train each tree on the same set the trees would be correlated so bagging helps in de-correlating the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../imgs/oob.jpg\" align=\"left\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin:20px 50px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameter of the forest is the number of decision trees to use. Its optimal value can be found indeed by observing the *out-of-bag error* (OOB), which is the mean prediction error on each sample $x_i$ using only the trees that did not have $x_i$ as a training sample. Looking at the OOB error is equivalent to running cross-validation. The optimal number of trees to use can be pinpointed by looking at the OOB error as a function of the number of trees: when the curve stabilises, it is a good indication that that quantity is sufficient."
