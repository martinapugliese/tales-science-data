# Some statistical paradoxes

## The Will Rogers effect

### The Will Rogers effect

The Will Rogers effect, named after the comedian Will Rogers, who was famous during the 20s and 30s of the last century, happens when you have two sets of data and move one item from one to the other, and the average of a value measured in both sets increases for both. The famous quote illustrating this, allegedly pronounced by Rogers, is

_When the Okies left Oklahoma and moved to California, they raised the average intelligence level in both states._

\(the Okies are the inhabitants of Oklahoma\). It's an apparent paradox and easily explained because it happens when the element moved from set A to set B is below average for A but above average for B.
