# Foundational concepts on distribution and measures

_What are probability distributions and how to quantify and measure what is needed to understand how the data looks like. Also, looking at how distributions of variables relate one another._

## Code & notebooks

For some interactivity, if you want to play around with the concepts here, there is code provided in the pages, as well as notebooks you can see [**here**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/martinapugliese/tales-science-data/tree/master/probability-statistics-and-data-analysis/foundational-concepts-on-distribution-and-measures/notebooks/).
