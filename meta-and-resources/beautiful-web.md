# Beautiful Web

_The web is a beautiful place, you can learn so much on it, for free. This document puts together some resources on or related to data science which are absolutely brilliant._

Topic-specific resources are already reported in every page for details, more insight, citation purposes. Here, we list material which is comprehensively good: online courses, books, blogs, and which span several of the topics we touch on in the book. All the material listed here can be of any format.

## Statistics and Probability

* _C Bergstrom_ and _J West,_  [**Calling Bullshit** **in the age of Big Data**](http://callingbullshit.org), a course on spotting manipulative use of data, wrong conclusions and overall misunderstandings
* _D Huff_, [**How to lie with Statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics), a lovely little book on the common mistakes and misunderstandings around the use of numbers for reaching conclusions. Old \(1954\), but very valuable and entertaining
* _T Vigen_, [**Spurious Correlations**](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), a project which visually displays improbable correlations between sets of data to demonstrate that, well, correlation is not causation
* \*\*\*\*[**Think Stats**](https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/thinkstats.pdf), an O'Reilly book by A B Downey, which is freely available online
* \*\*\*\*[**Seeing Theory**](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/index.html), a visual introduction to probability and statistics
* A [**probability cheatsheet**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf) by W Chen

## Machine Learning - general material

* \*\*\*\*[Notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) from the **Stanford CS229 Course on Machine Learning** \(all lecture notes are open-access\)
* [**R2D3**](http://www.r2d3.us/), a visual introduction to Machine Learning, project by S Yee and T Chu

## Neural Networks

* _M Nielsen_, [**Neural Networks & Deep Learning**](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), Determination Press, 2015, a fantastic online book
* \*\*\*\*[**Deep Learning with Keras & Tensorflow**](https://github.com/leriomaggio/deep-learning-keras-tensorflow)**,** a set of tutorials in Jupyter notebooks by _V Maggio_
* _F Chollet_, **Deep Learning with Python**, Manning, 2017, a book by the creator of Keras
* The [**TensorFlow Neural Network playground**](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.26634&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false), an interactive tool to visualise the inner workings of ANNs

## Computer Vision

* \*\*\*\*[**The Hypermedia Image Processing Reference**](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/index.htm), a website built by the University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics
* [**Pyimagesearch**](https://www.pyimagesearch.com), a website curated by A Rosebrock on Computer Vision and Machine/Deep Learning on images, with tutorials for OpenCV and lots of good material

## Coding

* [**Sorting Algorithms**](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) ****interactives, by Toptal

## Python references relevant to Data Science

* [**Scipy lecture notes**](http://scipy-lectures.org/index.html) - they're pretty brilliant and obviously focussed on Python, but you can learn lots of concepts in data
* [**scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) has tutorials and extensive explanations for every algorithm they support, as well as general notes on Machine Learning
* \*\*\*\*[**The Hitchhiker's guide to Python**](https://docs.python-guide.org/) \(not particularly targeted at data science, but a very useful reference\)
