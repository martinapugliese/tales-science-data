    "Let's say you have a big $m \\times n$ matrix $V$, with NMF you are able to factorise it into the product of matrices $W$ ($m \\times p$) and $H$ ($p \\times n$), with the property that $p \\ll m, n$ and $p$ playing the role of the *hidden features* in the data. The typical use case is that of a big sparse matrix factorised into two smaller dense matrices, which are much easier to deal with for computations. \n",

    "V \\approx W H \\ .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, $p$ is chosen precisely in such a way that $WH$ is a reasonable approximation of $V$. The real full decomposition is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V = WH + U \\ ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U$ is the residuals matrix, whose elements can be either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way to proceed in finding $W$ and $H$ is to use [gradient descent](../algorithms/gradient-descent.ipynb) by looking at minimising the difference between $V$ and $WH$ with the constraint of non-negativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are working with text and doing some NLP on documents. We have a [term-document matrix](../../nlp/concepts/representations.ipynb#Term-document-matrix) $V$, $10^2 \\times 10^5$ and we would like to extract 10 features in order to generate a features matrix $W$ with $10^4$ rows and 10 columns and a coefficient matrix $H$ with 10 rows and $10^2$ columns. The product of $WH$ woiuld then have $10^4$ rows and $10^2$ columns, working as a reasonable approximation of the original $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other typical applications are those where you have the matrix of users' ratings on items (products, movies, ...) and you'd want to discover some $p$ latent features. $W$ will give you the association of users to these hidden features and $H$ the association of the items to these hidden features. Once obtained the factorisation, you can use it to predict the rating a given user $u_i$ would give to an item $d_j$, as\n",
